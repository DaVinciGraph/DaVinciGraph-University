# Understanding Staking and Farming

## What is Staking?

Staking is the process of actively participating in transaction validation (similar to mining) on a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain. By holding or "locking up" a certain amount of tokens, you're essentially supporting the network's security and operations. In return, you earn rewards, usually in the form of additional tokens. It's a great way to help maintain the blockchain's integrity while growing your crypto holdings.

## What is Farming?

Farming, or yield farming, involves lending your crypto assets to others through the magic of smart contracts. In return, you earn fees or interest in the form of cryptocurrency. Farming can be riskier than staking because it often involves more complex strategies and a deeper understanding of the market. However, it can also be more rewarding.
