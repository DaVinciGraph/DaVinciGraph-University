## What is Hedera Token Service (HTS)?

The Hedera Token Service provides a fast, secure, and efficient way to issue and manage tokens on the Hedera Hashgraph network. Unlike traditional blockchain platforms, Hedera Hashgraph leverages a unique consensus algorithm designed for high throughput, low fees, and minimal energy consumption. HTS is built on top of this innovative platform, enabling users to mint, configure, and transfer fungible (like cryptocurrencies) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs, such as digital art or collectibles) with ease.
